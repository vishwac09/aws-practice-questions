# AWS Practice Question

React application allowing users to practice the AWS certification examination questions in a __Multiple Choice__ question format. Built this small application to learn and practice react concepts, components, theme layer, redux etc and also to get ready for the AWS certifications.

I have recently also created some notes for the [AWS Cloud practitioner](https://github.com/vishwac09/aws-cloud-practitioner#other-services) certification. I will add more questions, notes and guides on clearing more AWS certifications.

> I am a newbie in REACT. If you wish to contribute to the application or find any issues or an incorrectly implemented logic please raise an issue or create a pull request. Happy to learn from the experts.

The application layout is Two column (sidebar and a main content region). The sidebar list the total number of certifications enabled/available, clicking the certification highlight's and starts the corresponding certification exam.

##### Certification List
The list is populated by reading the the certifications.json file which can be found in the "data/" directory. Field "active" controls the visibility of that certification.

##### Questions
Every certification read from the certifications.json file points to the associated questions "json" file.

##### Redux
The application uses Redux to store the state of the application. Every component registers it own state.
